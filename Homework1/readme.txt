Oh man, this was a nightmare but I certainly learned quite a bit. Thank you very much for your help. Everything is working correctly, nesting properly and readjusting as I would expect. I used intellij to build my uml diagram and then I edited it so it would only show the needed classes. If you want me to draw it I can. I already have a drawn version, I would just need to clean it up. If this uml does not statisfy your requirements let me know and I will gladly update it. 

I also went through and made the changes you suggested. 

This program is the begining of our wysiwyg text editor Lexi. Running this program will currently display a main column with 2 nested rows and a single column nested inside the top-most row.

Again, thank you very much for your assistance and patience.
